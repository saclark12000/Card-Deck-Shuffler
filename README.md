# Deck-Shuffler
Python based project to compare shuffles between standard deck of cards.
Self-guided project that does the following:

Creates a fresh deck of cards;
Shuffles deck of cards;
Compares shuffled deck with decks already stored in shuffleddecksofcards.txt;
Saves shuffled deck to shuffleddecksofcards.txt on a new line;
Saves any individual matched cards to cardmatches.csv;
Saves any whole deck matches to deckmatches.txt (lol);
